# Boston Housing Regression
This project performs regression analysis using different models on the Boston Housing dataset to predict housing prices. The goal is to identify the best-fit model by evaluating key metrics such as:
- Statistical significance.
- Multicollinearity (Variance Inflation Factor - VIF).
- Model performance (Mean Squared Error & RÂ² score).

The analysis involves feature selection, scaling, transformation, and validation to ensure a robust and interpretable results.
