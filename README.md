# Multiple-Linear-Regression
In this project, I performs multiple linear regression analysis on the Boston Housing dataset to predict housing prices. The goal is to arrive at the best-fit model through an iterative process, evaluating key metrics such as:
- Statistical significance (p-values)
- Multicollinearity (Variance Inflation Factor - VIF)
- Model performance (Mean Squared Error - MSE & RÂ² score)

The analysis involves feature selection, diagnostics, and validation to ensure a robust and interpretable model.
